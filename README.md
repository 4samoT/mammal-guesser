# mammal-guesser
Program created for the Programming in Logic course that guesses the mammal that the user is thinking of, by asking yes or no questions about the characteristics of this animal.
Written in ProLog using the concept of family trees and predicates.
The questions are asked in portuguese.

To use it, must load the ProLog package at the shell ("swipl mammal.pl") and type "start.". To answer the questions, type "sim."/"yes." if positive and "nao."/"no." if negative.
